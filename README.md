# Appendix and Replication Materials for Holt, Kwiatkowski & Sullivan (2024)

## Overview

This repository collects supplemental material for Holt, Kwiatkowski & Sullivan (2024):

- The `data` directory contains Monte Carlo simulation results in `.csv` format
- The `mc-simulation` directory contains `Python` code for performing Monte Carlo simulations
- The `figures` directory contains `R` code for creating Figures 1, and A-1 through A-3 

**NB** The Monte Carlo simulations are computationally expensive. The simulations described in Holt, Kwiatkowski & Sullivan (2024) were conducted on dedicated hardware over a course of months.
